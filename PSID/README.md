This project uses survey data from the 2017 Release of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, conducted every other year on the same households by the Institute for Social Research, Survey Research Center, at the University of Michigan.

Using that data, we challenged ourselves to predict if a given respondent was a homeowner or not, establishing our independent and dependent variable set from the survey questions. Together, we utilized Python and common machine learning techniques, including cleaning and partitioning data to accomplish this goal. Lastly, we compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest Models to determine which was most effective at predicting our "Homeownership" outcome.

It is recommended to run our main file: Predicting Homeownership Official.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook Environment. 

Happy Predicting!
